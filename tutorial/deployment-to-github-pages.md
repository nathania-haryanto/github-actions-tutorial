# Deployment to GitHub Pages
Goal of this chapter is to build the angular application and deploy it to GitHub pages.
There are two possible ways to deploy your application to GitHub Pages:
1. Build your application, commit your output to an orphan branch and configure GitHub to deploy this branch.
2. (Beta) - Build your application and deploy it from the same action to GitHub Pages.
